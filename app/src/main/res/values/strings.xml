    <!--Airedale terrier    -->
    <string name="at1">One of Britain\'s key manufacturing centers before the turn of the 20th century, the Aire Valley lies in the north of England, less than a hundred miles from the Scottish border. In the mid-1800s, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, the valley\'s factory hands and mill workers first bred tough, devil-may-care Airedales in their own image. It\'s a neat irony that the King of Terriers was developed not by royals but workingmen. Airedales were created to be large and fearless hunters of ducks and rats, and no doubt did some poaching on the side.
        Fittingly for a dog from a manufacturing community, this was a \'manufactured\' breed: Several existing breeds went into its makeup. These include the Otterhound and such now-extinct breeds as the English Black and Tan Terrier. A practiced eye can also spot traces of the Irish Terrier and Bedlington Terrier in the Airedale. It\'s quite possible that setters, retrievers, and herding dogs also played a part in the development of the breed. Airedales served in the British Armed Forces with distinction during the First World War as messengers, sentries, and guard dogs.
        In North America, the breed was known as a three-in-one hunting dog, equally adept on waterfowl, upland gamebirds, and furred prey. This will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever owned an Airedale, as the breed\'s versatility is legendary. Ratter, duck dog, big-game hunter, herder, guardian, warrior, actor, athlete, K-9 cop, and babysitter are all jobs held at various times by the mighty King of Terriers.</string>
    <string name="at2">- Height: Female: 56–59 cm, Male: 58–61 cm\n\n- Weight: 23 – 29 kg (Male, Adult), 18 – 20 kg (Female, Adult)\n\n- Life span: 10 – 12 years\n\n- Temperament: Intelligent, Friendly, Alert, Outgoing, Confident, Courageous</string>
    <string name="at3">The Airedale Terrier, also called Bingley Terrier and Waterside Terrier, is a dog breed of the terrier type that originated in the valley of the River Aire, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is traditionally called the "King of Terriers" because it is the largest of the terrier breeds.</string>
    <string name="at4">Feeding. The Airedale Terrier must be fed high quality, high protein type foods. A adult grain-free dry kibble will suffice all their dietary needs.</string>
    <string name="at5">Airedales are prone to a common condition called hypothyroidism in which the body doesn\'t make enough thyroid hormone. Signs can include dry skin and coat, hair loss, susceptibility to other skin diseases, weight gain, fearfulness, aggression, or other behavioral changes.</string>


    <!--American Bully    -->
    <string name="About1">The American Bully is a modern breed of dog that was developed as a companion dog, and originally standardized and recognized as a breed in 2004 by the American Bully Kennel Club.
        Their published breed standard describes the dog as giving the "impression of great strength for its size".</string>
    <string name="Traits1">- Height: 33–50 cm (13–20 in)\n\n- Weight: 20–60 kg (44–132 lb)\n\n- Life span: 8-13 years\n\n- Temperament: Friendly, Loving, Gentle, Caring, and Playful
    </string>
    <string name="Note1">- American Bullies are very affectionate, outgoing, and patient dogs. A common misconception about the American Bully breed is that its parent breed (American Pit Bull Terrier) is more aggressive and is sometimes referred to as dangerous dogs. So most people conclude that this breed is dangerous, which is not true.</string>
    <string name="Food1">The other half must come from meat or meat-based or quality meat by-product sources. Examples of meat-based or healthy meat by-product protein that you would look for on an ingredient list include: heart, liver, kidneys, spleen and/or intestines (emptied), lamb, beef, fish – salmon and herring, poultry – chicken, turkey and duck, and animal-based dairy products – eggs, milk, and cheese.
        \n\nNot only is protein required to build and repair muscles, important for your Bully, but the amino acids are also important in forming new skin cells and healthy hair growth.
        \n\nCertain hormone creation and activity requires protein, as do enzymes to perform their work. Proteins also help to keep the immune system strong. Your Bully isn\’t able to store protein either, so it\’s an essential part of the daily diet.</string>
    <string name="health1">Common American Bully health issues include hip and elbow dysplasia, Hypothyroidism, heart disease, ear infections, and dental disease. American Bullies have grown in popularity in the last decade following the United Kennel Club recognition in 2013</string>

    <!--Australian Shepperd    -->
    <string name="as1">The Australian Shepherd is descended from a line of Europe\'s finest herders.The Aussie\'s world tour began in Europe, near the Pyrenees Mountains. It was here, in the borderlands between France and Spain, where the indigenous people known as the Basques built their centuries-old reputation as world-class shepherds. Their herding dog of choice was called the Pyrenean Shepherd, progenitor of our modern Aussie.
        \n\nIn the early 1800s, Australia\'s Anglo ÃomigrÃos began a push into the continent\'s vast interior in search of rich pastureland for cattle ranching. Eventually, many Basques, with their faithful shepherd dogs in tow, sailed east to try their luck on the virgin Australian continent, a wide-open paradise for sheep herders.        During their long sojourn in Australia, the Basque shepherd refined their dogs with judicious crosses to Australia\'s British imports, Collies and Border Collies, among them. After building up their flocks, the intrepid Basques left Australia for greener pastures \'literally\' and set sail to California.
        \n\nCalifornia ranchers admired the Basques\' herding dogs and assumed they were an Australian breed\' thus the misleading name Australian Shepherd. Aussies, further refined and perfected in America, have been an iconic part of cowboy culture ever since. Many are still happily herding in the American West, others earn their feed as rodeo performers, and still others of this exuberantly versatile breed work as therapy dogs, drug detectors, service dogs, and search-and-rescue dogs. The Australian Shepherd entered the AKC Herding Group in 1993.</string>
    <string name="as2">- Height: Male: 51–58 cm, Female: 46–54 cm\n\n- Weight: Male: 25–32 kg, Female: 16–25 kg\n\n- Life span: 10 – 12 years\n\n- Temperament: Intelligent, Friendly, Alert, Outgoing, Confident, Courageous\n\n- Colors: Merle, Black, Red Merle, Blue Merle, Black tricolor, Red tricolor, Red</string>
    <string name="as3">The Australian Shepherd is a breed of herding dog from the United States. The name of the breed is technically a misnomer, as it was developed in California in the 19th century, although it has its origins in Asturias, in the northwest of Spain; the breed was unknown in Australia at the time.</string>
    <string name="as4">When selecting what to feed your Australian Shepherd, choose a diet with high-quality animal-based protein sources, such as beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, duck, eggs, and fish.</string>
    <string name="as5">Aussies are generally healthy dogs, and a responsible breeder will test breeding stock for health concerns such as hip dysplasia, epilepsy, cataracts and certain forms of cancer. An Aussie\'s ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and his teeth should be brushed regularly.</string>

    <!--Basset hound    -->
    <string name="bh1">Basset Hounds were originally bred in France and Belgium basset is French for low. It is thought that the friars of the Abbey of St. Hubert were responsible for crossing strains of older French breeds to create a low-built scenting hound that could plod over rough terrain while followed on foot by a human hunting partner tracking rabbit and deer. Their accuracy and persistence on scent made Bassets a popular choice for French aristocrats, for whom hunting was a way of life.</string>
    <string name="bh2">- Height: Female: 28–36 cm, Male: 30–38 cm\n\n- Weight: 25 – 34 kg (Male, Adult), 20 – 29 kg (Female, Adult)\n\n- Life span: 10 – 12 years\n\n- Temperament: Sweet-Tempered, Friendly, Tenacious, Devoted, Affectionate, Gentle\n\n- Colors: Lemon &amp; White, Tri-color, Black &amp; Brown, White &amp; Chocolate, Red &amp; White, Black &amp; White</string>
    <string name="bh3">The Basset Hound is a short-legged breed of dog in the hound family. The Basset is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare. Their sense of smell and ability to ground-scent is second only to the Bloodhound. Basset Hounds are one of six recognized "basset"-type breeds in France.</string>
    <string name="bh4">Opt for a dog food that lists high-quality animal-based proteins as the main ingredients, such as chicken, turkey, or fish. These proteins provide essential amino acids for muscle development and maintenance. Basset Hounds may have food sensitivities or allergies, so be mindful of potential allergens in their food.</string>
    <string name="bh5">As a short breed with a long back the Basset Hound is at risk for any number of back problems. Herniated disc and spinal conditions, such as Intervertebral Disc Disease are common among Bassets. BH owners should be very cautious on how they lift their dog.</string>

    <!--Beagle   -->
    <string name="About2">Beagle dog breeds are of English origin and were primarily bred to hunt hares and rabbits. These dogs are also called \‘scent hounds\’, meaning they are known for their heightened sense of smell.
        They possess superior tracking skills, making them great hunters.</string>
    <string name="Traits2">- Height: It stands 13-15 inches tall\n\n- Weight: A healthy Beagle weighs between 10.0–11.3 kg\n\n- Lifespan: is 12–15 years\n\n- Temperament: Friendly, gentle, playful, curious
    </string>
    <string name="Note2">Beagles exhibit a gentle, sweet, and humorous nature that can bring plenty of laughter. However, their mischievous behavior may sometimes lead to moments of frustration. Beagle owners often find themselves attempting to outsmart their clever companions and resorting to food rewards to encourage temporary obedience.
        Just like any dog, early socialization is crucial for Beagles. Exposing them to diverse people, sights, sounds, and experiences during their youth helps ensure they grow into well-rounded and balanced adults.</string>
    <string name="Food2">A beagle\'s diet should consist of high-quality, protein-rich dog food that is formulated for their size and energy level. They do well on a diet of lean meats such as chicken, fish, or turkey, as well as vegetables and whole grains</string>
    <string name="health2">Along with caring for their mental well-being, Beagles need special attention paid to their physical health, too. Their floppy ears make them more prone to ear infections, so pet parents need to clean their Beagle\’s ears regularly. They’re also prone to obesity, so they need measured meals spaced at regular time intervals (free-feeding is not recommended).</string>

    <!--Bichon Frise    -->
    <string name="bf1">Bichons are a member of the clan of little white dogs formally known as Barbichon types. (These also include the Bolognese, Havanese, and Maltese.) It is thought that these ancient breeds began their modern development on Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands. One of these breeds became so popular with the island\'s sailors that it was known as the Bichon Tenerife, the primary ancestor of today\'s Bichon Frise. The breed\'s close association with European nobles began sometime in the 13th century.
        Most notably, they endeared themselves to the royal courts of Spain, Italy, and France, and came into their own during the Renaissance. With the advent of the French Revolution in 1789, the Bichon\'s days as the pampered and perfumed lapdog of aristocrats came to a rude end. One by one the breed\'s benefactors were trotted off to prison and the guillotine, and their Bichons lost their positions of privilege. Many were turned out into the street to fend for themselves. Street entertainers took in the bright, agile dogs and trained them coax a coin or two from passersby with their antics. Soon, the Bichon was earning his keep as a circus performer.
        Trainable, impossibly cute, and always at their best when in the spotlight, Bichons were excellent candidates for showbiz success. In the 20th century Bichons again faced hard times because of the shortages and austerities brought on by the two world wars. And again, many Bichons found themselves out in the cold. Thanks to a few fanciers who gathered Bichons off the streets of France and Belgium, the breed survived and was recognized in France under the auspices of the SocietyÃ© Centrale Canine in1933 as the Bichon a Poil FriesÃ©\'¿the \'Bichon of the curly hair.\' The Bichon Frise Club of America was founded at San Diego in 1964.
        The AKC accepted the Bichon into the Miscellaneous class in 1971, and full breed recognition in the Non-Sporting Group came two years later.</string>
    <string name="bf2">- Height: 9.5-11.5 inches\n\n- Weight: 5.4 – 8.2 kg (Adult)\n\n- Life span: 12 – 15 years\n\n- Temperament: Playful, Affectionate, Cheerful, Feisty, Sensitive, Gentle\n\n- Colors: Colour: White</string>
    <string name="bf3">A Bichon Frisé is a small breed of dog of the bichon type.</string>
    <string name="bf4">When selecting what to feed your Bichon Frise, choose a diet with high-quality animal-based protein sources, such as beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, duck, eggs, and fish.</string>
    <string name="bf5">The potential health problems that Bichons are prone to include: Luxating patellas – the kneecaps slipping temporarily out of place. Allergies. Cataracts – opacity of the lens of the eye – giving a \'cloudy\' appearance.</string>

    <!--Chihuahua    -->
    <string name="About4">As with so many breeds, the Chihuahua\’s origins are unclear, but there are two theories of how he came to be. The first is that he descended from a Central or South American dog known as the Techichi. When we look at the evidence of the Chihuahua coming from Central and South America, we find ourselves looking back to the Toltec civilization.
        There are Toltec carvings dating to the 9th century C.E. that depict a dog resembling the Chihuahua, with the same large ears and round head. These dogs were called Techichi.</string>
    <string name="Traits4">- Height: 6 inches to 9 inches tall at the shoulder\n\n- Weight: 3 to 6 pounds\n\n- Lifespan: 10 to 18 years\n\n- Temperament:  Feisty, independent, loyal, playful </string>
    <string name="Note4">The bold and confident Chihuahua is often described as being terrier-like. His alert nature and suspicion of strangers make him an excellent watchdog. He\’s sensitive and thrives on affection and companionship. Chihuahuas often bond to a single person, although they\’re usually willing to make friends with new people if properly introduced.</string>
    <string name="Food4">Chihuahuas are already prone to obesity and heart problems, a lean animal protein will contain less fat than other protein sources and thus promote a healthy weight. Common sources of lean animal protein to look for in a food for your Chihuahua include turkey, chicken, fish, and lean beef.</string>
    <string name="health4">The Chihuahua, being a petite breed prone to dental issues, hypoglycemia, and respiratory sensitivities, requires gentle handling, regular dental care, and temperature considerations, while also benefitting from weight management, preventative veterinary check-ups, and a commitment to socialization for their well-being, given their potential for a long lifespan of 12-20 years.</string>

    <!--Chow chow    -->
    <string name="About5">This unique and fascinating dog is of Chinese origin and is steeped in oriental mystery. Chow Chows have retained their individuality and distinctive appearance since 150 BC and early records show it was used by the Emperors as guard dogs and hunters. The Chow Chow as we know it first appeared in England in 1781, but they did not gain prominence until a century later. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this medium-sized dog is its blue-black tongue – a feature it shares with the bear.</string>
    <string name="Traits5">- Height: 17-20 inches tall\n\n- Weight: 20 to 32 kg\n\n- Lifespan: is 8-12 years\n\n- Temperament: Temperament: Aloof, Loyal, Independent, Quiet
    </string>
    <string name="Note5">Chow Chows tend to handle being left alone at home well and are generally calm and quiet. However, caution is needed when they are around children, as they may not adapt easily to the energetic playfulness of kids. These dogs are known for their loyalty to their adopted family members and rarely bark unless necessary.</string>
    <string name="Food5">When selecting what to feed your Chow Chow, choose a diet with high-quality animal-based protein sources, such as beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, duck, eggs, and fish.</string>
    <string name="health5">Health issues for the Chow Chow may include eyelid entropion, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, allergies, and thyroid function. These issues may be minimized by health screening, responsible breeding, and regular health care and can be diagnosed and managed with veterinary care.</string>


    <!--Corgi    -->
    <string name="About6">The Pembroke Corgi originated from the hardy, bob-tailed cattle dogs of the Pembrokeshire area in Wales. Due to being chosen as a pet by the British Royal Family in 1935, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is now one of the best-known breeds in the world. It is highly successful in both show and obedience rings worldwide, and extremely popular as a family pet.</string>
    <string name="Traits6">- Height: 10 to 12 inches tall at the shoulder\n\n- Weight: Up to 30 pounds\n\n- Lifespan: 12 to 14 years\n\n- Temperament: Playful, Tenacious, Friendly, Bold, Outgoing, Protective</string>
    <string name="Note6">When bored, Corgis can become noisy, so responsible owners should always ensure that their dog has activities to occupy its day.</string>
    <string name="Food6">High-quality protein sources, such as turkey, chicken, beef, or lamb. Nutrient-rich ingredients, including turkey liver, flaxseed, and salmon oil.</string>
    <string name="health6">Do corgis have a lot of health issues? Like many pure-bred dogs, corgis have their fair share of health issues. They are particularly prone to hip dysplasia and intervertebral disk disease (IVDD), although they may also develop epilepsy, cataracts, degenerative myelopathy and other common disorders.</string>

    <string name="Note8">Dalmatians may be predisposed to bladder stones. Some dogs are prone to skin trouble, while some are born deaf.</string>
    <string name="Food8">When selecting what to feed your Dalmatian, choose a diet with high-quality animal-based protein sources, such as beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, duck, eggs, and fish.</string>
    <string name="health8">Dalmatians shouldn\’t be left alone for long periods of time—not only because they crave activity, but also because they can experience separation anxiety. They need a family of homebodies or people who are willing to take their dog with them wherever they go. </string>

    <!--Doberman    -->

    <!--Golden Retriever    -->
    <string name="About11">Around the mid-to-late 1800s, the first Lord of Tweedmouth, Dudley Marjoribanks developed the Golden Retriever dog breed. These dogs are Scottish in origin. Marjoribanks bred these dogs as gun hounds for over 50 years. He wanted the dog to adjust to his area\'s rainy climate and have a friendly temperament as well.
        Therefore, he crossed his yellow retriever with a now-extinct breed called the Tweed water spaniel. In 1908, the Golden Retriever made its first official appearance at the British Dog Show.</string>

    <string name="Food11">Avoid foods that have grain as the first ingredient. Also look for multiple meat proteins in the first seven ingredients. Protein from multiple sources is generally viewed as being beneficial (such as lamb, chicken and fish), unless your dog is allergic to certain proteins. Dog food companies sometimes list several types of grains in the first seven ingredients. Beware of this – your dog needs animal protein in his diet!</string>
    <string name="Health11">The Golden Retriever, known for its friendly disposition, may face health concerns like hip dysplasia, certain heart conditions, and a predisposition to obesity, underscoring the need for regular exercise, a controlled diet, and proactive veterinary attention to promote their health and longevity.</string>

    <!--Jack Russell    -->
    <string name="jr1">The Russell and Parson Russell terriers share a common heritage as fox-working dogs from the kennels of Rev. John \'The Sporting Parson\' Russell of the mid-1800s. Since the parson\'s day, the lines of the two terriers have diverged and are now recognized as two distinctly separate breeds. Russells were bred to be swift enough to run with the hounds and tough but compact enough to go to ground and bolt prey.</string>
